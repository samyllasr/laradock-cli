# Laradock CLI helper

This project aims to set a couple of conventions to ease developing using the already easy [Laradock](https://github.com/laradock/laradock) project.

Still a PoC, but already working.

## Dependencies

* You need Docker and docker-compose installed (latest versions)
* You need PHP 7.1 locally
* You also need git configured locally

We have a [Getting Started guide](./docs/01-getting-started.md). Check it out.
